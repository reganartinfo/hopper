# Hopper at the Theatre

## Linked Open Data for Museums Fellowship
Whitney Museum of American Art x Pratt Institute School of Information

## Proposal
This project investigates the cultural and theatrical landscape of Edward Hopper's New York using linked open data (LOD) technologies. Leveraging the unparalleled collection of Hopper's art and archival materials held by the Whitney Museum of American Art, *Hopper at the Theatre* contextualizes the artist's personal and professional geographies towards the end of the interwar period. Part one of this project targets primary source metadata for semantic enrichment from event ticket stubs in the newly established Sanborn Hopper Archive. By augmenting the Whitney's unique dataset with geospatial data from alternative sources and external information silos, deliverables for Pratt SI [LIS-664-01](http://pfch.nyc/) will include an interactive map and timeline built with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/).
